Read Later is a Chrome extension that lets you save web pages to read later with just one click. It shows a list of saved pages in a popup, and you can click on any to open them in new tabs. It's great for when you find something interesting but don't have time to read it right away.

Feel free to modify the code and use it as you like. If you have any questions or suggestions, please let me know.
